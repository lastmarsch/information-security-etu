# Task
1. Find CAPEC attack patterns related to the vulnerabilities you’ve found in previous labs.
    
    - Analyze CWEs found in lab 4.

    - Write code that will output CAPEC attack patterns for the weaknesses you’ve found in lab.4 (if any).

2. Analyse CAPEC data feeds (CAPEC Scheme). Are there any fields that indicate, how attack can be mitigated?

    - If in task 7.1 you’ve found attack patterns and these patterns include filled mitigations fields – write the code that will output these mitigations.

    *Otherwise:* 

    - Write code that will select random CAPEC attack pattern containing filled mitigations field in the CAPEC database.

3. Analyze CAPEC data feeds (CAPEC Scheme). Are there any metrics?

    https://capec.mitre.org/data/xsd/ap_schema_latest.xsd
    
    - List them and their possible values (for this goal analyze CAPEC scheme). Expected output: list the metrics and their values.
